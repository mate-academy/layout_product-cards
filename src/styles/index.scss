// 1. reset browsers default margins, so body and/or html needs to be margin 0.
// 2. card width is 200px including border, so what I could do is either A width - border or B I could do box-sizing style.
// 3. Need to use image from the folder. I should be able to use an <img> tag this time.
// 4. Link styles on :hover needs to be changed. It is NOT a BUTTON, it is a LINK so <li><a>Buy</a></li>. on Hover the button needs to go from all blue to white with blue border.
// 5. Need to add `data-qa="card"` attribute to the card, basically the parent of the card.
// 6. Need to add `data-qa="hover"` attribute to the link `BUY`
// 7. `background-image: url()` should be relative to the `index.scss`. So it should start with `../images`
// 8. I can rewrite STARS assignment with SASS and use it here.
// 9. I need to use a different FONT, currently i am not sure which one. Maybe its the one from Navbar exercise?? As in catalog task I think i will have to reuse the navbar. Fonts -> [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
