- check your work using basic recommendations [here](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_search-bar-airbnb/blob/master/checklist.md)
- use stars from `stars-block` task
- check your classes, are they ok? do they follow BEM methodology?
- don't add border to the button on hover. Add it to initial button state and make `transparent`
- are you sure you've polished your code? :)
- BEM block should't have outer styles(like margin)
- stars should be the same as in [Stars task](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_stars)
